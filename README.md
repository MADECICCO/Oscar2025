Using social science data, as well as the international databases of the Oscar awards by country, age, gender, color, and current trends, on specialized sites and on social networks, and using Markov chains, draw up a probabilistic calculation of Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres win the Oscar statuette, as well as all the Oscar nominations for best actress in 2025. Take into account a comparison of the result of the model compared to the results obtained in the last 50 years of awarding best actress. Take into account data available on international websites , social networks and specialized websites of Europe and USA .

# 1. Historical Context and Social Data

    Since 1975, only 10% of the winners in the Best Actress category have been foreign, with most being American or British actresses. The last foreign winner was Marion Cotillard in 2008 by La Vie en Rose.

    The Academy has been seeking greater diversity in recent years, but there is still a predominance of white and English-speaking actresses among the winners. Latin and other nationalities’ and other nationalities face cultural and linguistic barriers.

    Age: The average age of the winners is 38 years. Fernanda Torres is 59 years old, which can be a negative factor, since the Academy tends to award performances of younger actresses.

   # 2. Analysis of the 2025 Candidates

The top Oscar contenders for Best Actress in 2025 are:

    Fernanda Torres (I’m Still Here): Golden Globe Winner for Best Actress in Drama, but with no indications for the SAG or BAFTA, which has historically reduced its chances1610.

    Demi Moore (The Substance): Favorite today, with strong campaigning and narrative of "triumphal return".

    Cynthia Erivo (Wicked): Nominated for SAG and BAFTA, with strong cultural and historical appeal.

    Karla Sofía Gascón (Emilia Pérez): First trans actress nominated for the Oscar, with strong symbolic appeal10.

    Mikey Madison (Anora): Nominated for SAG and BAFTA, with well-received film.

  # 3. Probabilistic model with Markov chains

Using Markov chains, we can model the probability of victory based on:

    State transitions: Considering states as "appointed", "preliminary prize winner" (Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA) and "Academy winner".

    Transition Obability: Based on historical data (last 50 years) and current trends.

Steps of the Model:

    Data Collection: Use Oscar databases, preliminary awards, and social networks to create a transition matrix.

    Model Training: Apply machine learning techniques (logistical regression, neural networks) to predict the chances of transition.

    Simulation: Perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the chances of each candidate. 

# Comparação com os Últimos 50 Anos

    Atrizes Estrangeiras: Apenas 10% das vencedoras foram estrangeiras, com Marion Cotillard sendo a última em 2008.

    Vencedoras sem SAG ou BAFTA: Apenas 3 atrizes venceram o Oscar sem indicações ao SAG ou BAFTA, todas em categorias de coadjuvante.

    Filmes em Língua Não Inglesa: Apenas 5% das vencedoras de Melhor Atriz atuaram em filmes não falados em inglês.
